## Blogpost

If you want to know more about the background of this package, please read the blogpost: [Apply the opposite of your Eloquent scope to the Query Builder with a Laravel package](https://protone.media/blog/apply-the-opposite-of-your-eloquent-scope-to-the-query-builder-with-a-laravel-package).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-eloquent-where-not
```

Add the `macro` to the query builder, for example, in your `AppServiceProvider`. By default, the name of the macro is `whereNot`, but you can customize it with the first parameter of the `addMacro` method.

```php
use ProtoneMedia\LaravelEloquentWhereNot\WhereNot;

public function boot()
{
    WhereNot::addMacro();

    // or use a custom method name:
    WhereNot::addMacro('not');
}
```

## Short API description

*For a more practical explanation, check out the [usage](#usage) section below.*

Call the `whereNot` method with a Closure:
```php
Post::whereNot(function ($query) {
    $query->onFrontPage();
})->get();
```

The example above can be shortened by using a string, which should be the name of the scope:
```php
Post::whereNot('onFrontPage')->get();
```

You can use an array to call multiple scopes:
```php
Post::whereNot(['popular', 'published'])->get();
```

Use an associative array to call dynamic scopes:
```php
Post::whereNot(['ofType' => 'announcement'])->get();
```

If your dynamic scopes require multiple arguments, you can use an associative array:
```php
Post::whereNot(['publishedBetween' => [2010, 2020]])->get();
```

You can also mix dynamic and non-dynmaic scopes:
```php
Post::whereNot([
    'published',
    'ofType' => 'announcement'
])->get();
```

## Usage

Imagine you have a `Post` Eloquent model with a query scope that constraints the query to all posts that should make the front page.

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }

    public function scopeOnFrontPage($query)
    {
        $query->where('is_public', 1)
            ->where('votes', '>', 100)
            ->has('comments', '>=', 20)
            ->whereHas('user', fn($user) => $user->isAdmin())
            ->whereYear('published_at', date('Y'));
    }
}
```

Now you can fetch all posts for your front page by calling the scope method on the query:

```php
$posts = Post::onFrontPage()->get();
```

But what if you want to fetch *all* posts that *didn't* make the front page? Using the power of this package, you can re-use your scope!

```php
$posts = Post::whereNot(function($query) {
    $query->onFrontPage();
})->get();
```

With short closures, a feature which was introduced in PHP 7.4, this can be even shorter:

```php
$posts = Post::whereNot(fn ($query) => $query->onFrontPage())->get();
```

### Shortcuts

Instead of using a Closure, there are some shortcuts you could use (see also: [Short API description](#short-api-description)):

Using a string instead of a Closure:

```php
Post::whereNot(function ($query) {
    $query->published();
});

// is the same as:

Post::whereNot('published');
```

Using an array instead of Closure, to support multiple scopes and dynamic scopes:

```php
Post::whereNot(function ($query) {
    $query->ofType('announcement');
});

// is the same as:

Post::whereNot(['ofType' => 'announcement']);
```

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
